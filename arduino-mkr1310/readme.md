#### Findings
Power management of the MKR1310 is pretty good.
Had trouble using the Flash on the MKR1310. Some good example on the TTN website. Worked well with the Local Ardruino IDE Example _> https://github.com/AmedeeBulle/TTNMkrWanNode .Some issue with the MKR1300 Chip 1310 is much better.


### A little (Messy) Weather station.
