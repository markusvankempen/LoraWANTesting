##### Findings
TinyLora worked very well with the feather and the PI bonnet. Only ABP (Activation by Personalization) is support by TinyLora. Can not set a lot of lora parameters but all worked. With LIMC is a lot more felxible and offers more options. LIMC did not work well with the feather and the RAK7249.
